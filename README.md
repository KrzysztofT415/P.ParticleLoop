# ParticleLoop
Simple JavaScript website with generated animation of particles on continuous random loop.

It's purpose could be to be displayed in the background of website or just generating some nice-looking giphs.

As mine target I will expand this project in the future and use it on my website.

Test it yourself here https://krzysztoft415.github.io/P.ParticleLoop/
